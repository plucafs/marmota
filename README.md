Why?
-
As I was searching for a GUI ready to go, friendly, cluttered-free solution to use yt-dlp, I come up with different problem trying the most common ones.
So, I started developing my tool having in mind the simplest yet useful possibility. Hope it'll be helpfull!

How it works?
-
Skip to point 4 if you downloaded a release file.

0. Download [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/)
1. Install [FFmpeg](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#dependencies)
2. Download [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download)
3. Download the project, export it from Godot and open it
4. In the first space, click the button on the right and select the yt-dlp executable
5. In the second space, paste the youtube video link
6. In the third space, select the directory where you want the file to be saved in
7. Select the container (Audio+video / Audio only)
8. Download it!

It supports single video and playlist.

What's next?
-
- Choose a specific format (currently avaible only webm and opus, usually)
- Choose a custom name for the file
- User custom arguments
- Feel free to propose something!
